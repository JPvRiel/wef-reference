Spotting the Adversary with Windows Event Monitoring security guidance from NSA IAD provided several 
subscriptions to used for collecting specific events from Windows clients in a domain. This package complements 
the security guidance document. Tis package consist of several items:
* PowerShell scripts to automate certain task involving Windows Event Collection administration
	- Includes a script to create Custom Views for Event Viewer
* Subscriptions targeting Windows 7+ (specified events to collect)

Most of the subscriptions are documented within their respective XML file. 

Each subscription will have the AllowedSourceDomainComputers tag empty. AllowedSourceDomainComputers tags MUST be filled
with the intended group. 

All PowerShell script were developed and require PowerShell 4.0 (dot Net 4.5).
